Detailed instructions of how to build a Zyzzyva installer on OS X.
This is not totally up to date, but this is the basic process.

- Install Qt 4.3.2.  I usually install it to the default location,
/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.3.2.
- Export Zyzzyva x.y.z from
http://svn.boshvark.com/repos/projects/zyzzyva/tags/x.y.z.  Use "svn
export" instead of "svn checkout", because we don't want .svn
directories getting in the way.  Or you can just download the Zyzzyva
x.y.z source code tarball from the Zyzzyva web site.
- cd to your Zyzzyva x.y.z directory and run
installer/create-macx-dmg.sh.  This will build Zyzzyva, creating a
bundle and dmg in installer/macosx.
- Get BitRock InstallBuilder Multiplatform 4.1.0 (Enterprise) from
http://www.bitrock.com/download_installbuilder_download.html.  It must
be the Enterprise edition, not any of the others.
- Create a folder called $HOME/dev/zyzzyva-install and move the
installer/macosx directory into it.
- Get a tarball of Zyzzyva x.y.z Linux and Windows directories from
http://zyzzyva.net/packages/tmp/Zyzzyva-x.y.z-linux-windows.tar.gz.
Unzip it in the zyzzyva-install directory, which will create "linux"
and "windows" directories.  Without these, the stupid InstallBuilder
will complain.
- Edit installer/Zyzzyva.xml, replacing all instances of
"/Users/mthelen/dev/zyzzyva-install" with the path to your
zyzzyva-install directory.
- Start InstallBuilder and choose License->Register License from the
menu.  Give it the license I have attached to this message.
- There should be a link in InstallBuilder saying "open an existing
project".  Click it, and choose installer/Zyzzyva.xml inside your
Zyzzyva x.y.z directory.
- Click the Packaging button on the left hand side, choose "Mac OS X"
as your Build Platform, then click the Build button.  If all is well,
it should Just Work.
- Close InstallBuilder, and run
installer/create-macx-installer-dmg.sh, to create a disk image for the
installer.  It will be placed in the zyzzyva-install directory.
